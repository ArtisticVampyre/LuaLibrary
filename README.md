# LuaLibrary
## Everything Lua | All in one place!

Lua is an amazing language with an amazing community. There are hundreds and hundreds of wonderful projects and creations that pertain to the Lua language. I started this list purely because I wanted a place to store everything neat I had found.

Pull requests are welcome and encouraged, together we can make the largest library of information on Lua!

Inspired by the lists [awsome-lua](https://github.com/LewisJEllis/awesome-lua) and [lua-languages](https://github.com/hengestone/lua-languages)
